# Skills

A collection of Claude skills that I find useful.

## What Are Skills?

Skills are reusable instruction sets for Claude. They teach Claude how to handle specific tasks, workflows, or vocabularies -- things that would otherwise require repeating yourself every conversation. Install a skill once, and Claude knows how to use it going forward.

## Skills in This Repo
