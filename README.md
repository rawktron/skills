# Skills

A collection of agent skills I've created that I find useful.

## What Are Skills?

Skills are reusable instruction sets for AI Agents. They teach agents how to handle specific tasks, workflows, or vocabularies -- things that would otherwise require repeating yourself every conversation. Install a skill once, and the agent knows how to use it going forward.

## Skills in This Repo

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [ux-vocabulary](ux-vocabulary/) | A ~45-word UX vocabulary for describing interfaces in plain English with precision. Eliminates the ambiguity of natural language UX descriptions without reverting to code. |

## Installing

Download the skill folder and install it via your agent's skill import. Each skill has its own README with usage details.
